A bustling street scene in rome, italy, with pedestrians walking by shops like 'superman' and 'salvatore ferragamo'. the architecture is european, with buildings painted in warm yellows and oranges. a man in a white t-shirt and backpack looks over his shoulder, while a woman in a red coat and sunglasses walks forward. two seconds later, the scene shifts to a narrow street lined with yellow buildings, where people stroll under an awning labeled 'ristorante'. the atmosphere is vibrant, with a mix of casual and smart-casual attire, and a 'sale' sign on a storefront suggests commercial activity.
